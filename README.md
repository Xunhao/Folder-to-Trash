# Folder-to-Trash

## Goal of this project 
The goal of this project is simple which is to use Python to move files from a given folder into the trash bin. The said folder can be a location where you host most of your temporary files which are meant to be deleted at a later time. With this script, you can simply run and it would move **everything** into the trash bin for you. I choose to end the script after moving the files into the trash for a couple of reasons,

  1. To avoid tinkering with system related applications
  2. There is a feature that automatically empties the Trash Bin after 30 days for MacOS
  
You can choose to set a schedule to run this script periodcally instead of doing so manually to keep your folder clean.

## Personal Note
This is a simple but useful project, for me personally, because I perform many export operations that require me to store exported files on my local machine. I found myself constantly deleting files manually after my export work to keep things clean. So I thought of automating this part of my workflow.
